# Procedural 3D planet using shell texturing

This project is a sort of proof of concept to show how we can compute and display volumetric data on the fly in a fragment shader.

The program renders a set of concentric spheres, and the fragments shader "carves" the volume based on noise and pseudo-random functions, and compute the final pixel color.
